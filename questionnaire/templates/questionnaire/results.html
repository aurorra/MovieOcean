                                    People with a higher score in Extraversion tend to be sociable, talkative,
                                    assertive, and full of energy. They seek stimulation from the outside, mostly through
                                    interactions with other people.
                                    They feel comfortable in social situations and don't shy away from having
                                    conversations. So, it is not surprising that they surround themselves with
                                    many friends and are quick to form new friendships.
                                    As they are energetic and assertive, they are
                                    usually successful in reaching their goals. Achievements of all kinds get
                                    them excited. They prefer to change over maintaining the status quo.

                                        Individuals with with a higher score in conscientiousness tend to be
                                        disciplined, focused, careful, thorough, responsible, organized, and
                                        goal-oriented. They are reliable and prefer planned rather than
                                        spontaneous behavior.
                                        With their competence and self-discipline, they are usually successful
                                        in achieving their goals. They prefer stability and security over change or
                                        risk-taking. Because of their characteristics, a higher score in
                                        conscientiousness can lead to exam performance and
                                        academic success above the average.

                                    over competition, which makes them great team players. Dominance or power
                                    is not desirable for them. They offer great support for other people and are

                                    deeply. As they feel emotions more deeply, they might have increased
                                    negative emotions like sadness, anger, or anxiety. Taking risks or change
                                    is not pleasing for them. Their world view is rather realistic than optimistic.
                                    They are careful as some situations or behaviors might make them feel
                                    guilty in some way. They perceive injustice in the world more intensively than
                                    others and care about people even when they are far away in another country.

                                    They have a high tolerance for other people and different opinions and
                                    ideas. Tradition, structure, and stability is not their way of living.
                                    They come up with many creative ideas that might be conceived as
                                    unconventional by others. In addition, they have a vivid imagination and enjoy
